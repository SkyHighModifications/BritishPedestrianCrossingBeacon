# ðŸ’¡ British Pedestrian Crossing Beacon - V1.2.0 ðŸ’¡

## Overview

This script is designed for Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) introducing a British-style flashing beacon. As vehicles or players approach the pedestrian crossing, the beacon activates, providing a realistic and immersive representation of British traffic environments

## Features

- Intelligently detects nearby entities, focusing specifically on entities with the model `"prop_sign_road_05a"`. This targeted detection ensures that the flashing beacon is activated only in the context of pedestrian crossings.
- The script adapts the flashing lights based on the in-game time. During nighttime (between 6 PM and 6 AM), the lights have a lower intensity, while during daytime, they have a higher intensity. This adaptive lighting contributes to a more authentic experience.
- The script dynamically controls the flashing effect of the pedestrian crossing beacon. The beacon alternates between on and off states, creating a visually appealing and attention-grabbing element for nearby players.

Make sure you have [British UK Road Signs & Props](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/united-kingdom-road-signs) installed.
